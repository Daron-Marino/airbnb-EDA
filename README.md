# PROPOSALS
## Dataset 1:
### [Airbnb Listings and Metrics in NYC (2019)](https://www.kaggle.com/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data)
* This dataset contains information regarding Airbnb rentals in NYC for 2019. I am interested in investigating the following:

  * Hosts across neighborhood/neighborhood group
  * Room type across neighborhood/neighborhood group
  * Price across neighborhood/borough
  * Availability
  * Number of reviews

* ### Visualizations to Consider:
  * Distributions of prices across neighbohood/borough
  * Distributions of minimum nights across neighborhood/borough
  * Distribution of reviews across neighborhood/borough
  * Amount of listings per host across neighborhood/borough
  * Correlation between amount of listings per host and availability
  * Map plot that shows concentration of listings throughout the city based on latitude/longitude coordinates

* ### Hypotheses to Consider:
  * Whether certain neighborhods/boroughs have higher availability/amount of listings per host
  * Differences in pricing between neighborhoods/boroughs
  * Differences in pricing between hosts who have varying amounts of listings
